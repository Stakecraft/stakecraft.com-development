# Polygon POL Staking Fixes

## Issue Resolved

Fixed the "execution reverted" error that was occurring during POL token delegation.

## Root Causes and Fixes

### 1. **Incomplete Transaction Waiting**

**Problem:** The approval transaction wasn't being waited for completion before proceeding to delegation.
**Fix:** Added `await approveTx.wait()` to ensure approval confirms before delegation.

### 2. **Incomplete Balance Check**

**Problem:** Balance validation had incomplete error handling.
**Fix:** Added proper error message with actual vs required balance amounts.

### 3. **Missing Network Validation**

**Problem:** Users could attempt staking on wrong networks.
**Fix:** Added automatic network switching to Ethereum mainnet and validation.

### 4. **Incorrect Function Parameters**

**Problem:** `buyVoucherPOL` was called with `0` for minimum shares, which may cause reverts.
**Fix:** Changed to use `1` as minimum shares to mint.

### 5. **Missing Gas Limits**

**Problem:** Delegation transaction had no gas limit specified.
**Fix:** Added reasonable gas limits for both approval (100,000) and delegation (300,000).

### 6. **Poor Error Handling**

**Problem:** Generic error messages weren't helpful for troubleshooting.
**Fix:** Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios.

## Key Changes Made

### Network Validation

```javascript
// Automatically switches to Ethereum mainnet
async function switchToEthereumMainnet()

// Validates user is on correct network
async function validateNetwork(provider)
```

### Improved Transaction Flow

```javascript
// 1. Check balance
if (balance < amountWei) {
  throw new Error(
    `Insufficient POL balance. You have ${formatEther(balance)} POL but need ${formatEther(amountWei)} POL`
  )
}

// 2. Approve with wait
const approveTx = await polContract.approve(LAST_ADDRESS, amountWei, { gasLimit: 100000 })
await approveTx.wait() // Wait for confirmation

// 3. Delegate with proper parameters
const delegateTx = await voucherManager.buyVoucherPOL(amountWei, 1, { gasLimit: 300000 })
await delegateTx.wait() // Wait for confirmation
```

### Better Error Messages

- Insufficient balance errors show exact amounts
- Network errors guide user to switch networks
- Gas fee errors suggest adding ETH
- Contract errors provide troubleshooting context

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If Transaction Still Fails:

1. **Check Network:** Ensure you're on Ethereum Mainnet (not Polygon)
2. **Check ETH Balance:** You need ETH for gas fees (not POL)
3. **Check POL Balance:** Ensure sufficient POL tokens on Ethereum
4. **Try Lower Amount:** Start with minimum amount to test
5. **Check Gas Price:** High network congestion may require higher gas

### Common Error Messages:

| Error                                | Cause          | Solution                        |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| "Please connect to Ethereum Mainnet" | Wrong network  | Switch to Ethereum in MetaMask  |
| "Insufficient ETH for gas fees"      | No ETH for gas | Add ETH to wallet               |
| "Insufficient POL balance"           | Not enough POL | Get POL tokens or reduce amount |
| "Amount too small"                   | Below minimum  | Increase stake amount           |
| "Transaction was rejected"           | User cancelled | Approve transaction in MetaMask |

### Validator Requirements:

- Must be a valid Polygon validator
- Validator must accept delegations
- Check validator status on https://staking.polygon.technology/

### Minimum Requirements:

- Network: Ethereum Mainnet
- Gas Token: ETH (for transaction fees)
- Stake Token: POL (on Ethereum)
- Minimum Stake: Check contract's `minAmount()` function

## Testing Steps

1. Connect to Ethereum Mainnet
2. Ensure you have ETH for gas
3. Ensure you have POL tokens
4. Start with small test amount
5. Monitor console logs for detailed progress
6. Check transaction on Etherscan after success

## Support

If issues persist:

1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify contract addresses are correct
3. Test with different amounts
4. Check validator status and availability
5. Consider trying during lower network congestion periods
